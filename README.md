# What is a carbon footprint?
A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.

The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2℃ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.

Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn’t happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions, like eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.

# What is Sustainability
Sustainability is the ability to exist and develop without depleting natural resources for the future. We must balance economic, environmental and social factors in equal harmony. This may be illustrated with a sustainability Venn diagram, as shown below:

# PCAF
PCAF is a global partnership of financial institutions that work together to develop and implement a harmonized approach to assess and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their loans and investments.

The harmonized accounting approach provides financial institutions with the starting point required to set science-based targets and align their portfolio with the Paris Climate Agreement. PCAF enables transparency and accountability and has developed an open-source global GHG accounting standard for financial institutions, the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry.

# What are Greenhouse Gas Emission Scopes?
Greenhouse gas emissions include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane and four groups of fluorinated gases (sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and nitrogen trifluoride). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership between the World Resources Institute and the Business Council for Sustainable Development, categorizes greenhouse gas emissions into three Scopes:

Scope 1: Directly generated emissions resulting from the consumption of fuels in operations, transportation and fugitive emissions, such as accidental leaks. For example, a plant that burns natural gas onsite would include these emissions in its Scope 1 calculations.
Scope 2: Indirectly generated emissions resulting from the use of purchased electricity, steam, heating or cooling. For example, a plant that uses electricity purchased from a nearby power plant that generates emissions would include these emissions as part of its Scope 2.
Scope 3: All the other indirect emissions that result from a company’s activities across its value chain. For example, a company that sends wastewater to a treatment plant will need to account for the emissions associated with that wastewater treatment in its Scope 3 calculations.
